# Community Growth & Engagement

If you're reading this guide, then you're probably not on Bluesky just to have fun and blow off steam. You're likely an organization or a public figure that has a product, service, or cause that you need to promote to achieve your goals... and in order to do that, you need to get peoples' attention and sustain their interest in what you have to say. Thus, you need followers. 

But attracting followers wasn't easy on traditional social media, so it certainly isn't easy in a more decentralized environment like Bluesky. Plus, there are no advertisements on Bluesky, so you can't even use "paid media" to force your way into peoples' attentions pans. Instead, you have to provide valuable content that falls under the various categories we explored in the Audience & Culture section of this guide. This guide won't be teaching you how to do that, but it will be showing you how to apply that content creation to the unique context of Bluesky in a way that maximizes its potential. The last thing you want to do is simply copy your existing social media strategy from X, Facebook, or Instagram and paste it onto Bluesky. You don't have to completely rethink it from the ground up, but you do need to intentionally adapt it.

## Formatting and packaging your content for Bluesky

1. Use links liberally, without any weird hacks

As we've discussed in previous sections, Bluesky does not suppress outbound links to other websites. This means that you don't need to perform the same algorithmic gymnastics just to sneak in a link to your website. Instead of making a main post and then following up with a reply containing the link or pointing to your bio, just put the link in the main post. If you keep using the workarounds from other platforms when you post to Bluesky, many people will see your activity as half-hearted, ignorant, or even cringe. On Bluesky, people like links and don't want to have to go searching for them in weird places.

2. If you post images, always include alt text

Moreso than in other places, a non-insignificant part of Bluesky's culture cares a lot about web accessibility. By including alt text on your images, you're being inclusive to people with certain disabilities, but you're also making your content more discoverable because alt text is included in search results. For instance, if you post a screenshot of a document or longer-form text as an image, you should include all of that text as alt text. If you didn't do this, then your post would not end up in relevant search results where it otherwise could and should. There are even Bluesky users who refuse to share content from other accounts if alt text isn't present.

3. Be careful and mindful of your hashtag usage

While hashtags are supported on Bluesky and used in many different contexts, including them in all of your posts can be seen as a desperate attempt for attention and a form of engagement hacking in many spheres. Depending on your industry and context though, the usage of hashtags might be more normal and prevalent. It's wise to take a look at what other accounts in your community/niche are doing to see what is and isn't common practice.

4. Consider the variables or conditions of relevant topical feeds

Remember, Bluesky doesn't just have one algorithmic feed. It has a limitless number of customizable user-generated algorithms in addition to its default "Discover" algorithm. Many people disable the default algorithm completely and choose to rely upon more niche or topical feeds instead. For instance, there are community-controlled feeds dedicated to lovers of mushrooms/fungi, web development, and academic research. Each of these feeds has a custom algorithm with different conditions/rules that dictates which posts or content show up in the feed (for instance, this is often a good use-case for hashtags). Consider if there are any popular feeds in your niche that would welcome your contributions. If you do find such feeds, try to see if there is any public documentation available that shows how the feed works, and then use that information appropriately while crafting your related content.

Be warned though, if your activity violates the norms or rules of a custom feed, your entire account could get banned from ever appearing in it again. Don't be a bad actor.

5. There is no edit button, so spell-check your content carefully

Most social platforms these days allow for editing a post if you make a typo or need to add something after the fact. Bluesky does not currently support this feature though. While it is technically possible to edit posts under the hood on the protocol level, doing so is a bit technical, requires third-party tools, and usually is not advisable (it also will reset the post's engagement stats).

6. You can embed videos and audio from some third-party services directly in a post

While it doesn't make sense to post a YouTube link on Twitter/X anymore because of suppression, Bluesky embraces offsite media content and allows users to watch/listen without ever leaving the app. At the time of writing, the following services are supported: YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, GIPHY, Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, and Flickr.

## Leveraging Bluesky's unique features for growth and engagement

Finally, let's cover some of the most exciting and interesting elements of using Bluesky for community growth/engagement. At the time of writing, the following features are unique to Bluesky and cannot be found on any other mainstream social network to date. There is very little documentation about these features at the moment, especially in regard to how they can be used appropriately and effectively to impact an audience. Some of these things are easy to leverage, while others require a higher level of technical knowledge and time.

1. Labelers (Advanced/Expert)

A Labeler is a customizable integration that can be used to display helpful information within the Bluesky app. They are used to apply textual and visual labels to either specific accounts or specific posts. These labels are only visible to users who "Subscribe" to the Labeler, meaning users must explicitly opt-in for the tags to appear in the user interface of their app.

While Labelers were originally designed as a "serious" moderation tool, they have now evolved to include even more casual or even silly use cases. For instance, the official Bluesky company released a Superbowl Labeler for the 2025 Superbowl which allowed users to apply a label to their accounts to display which football team they were rooting for. Other Labelers use more advanced technology to automatically analyze and categorize accounts/posts based on publicly available data. 

Let's say you are a video game studio with a beloved game that has many different playable characters. You could create a Labeler that would allow your community members to tag their profile with their preferred character's name. Or, maybe you are a coffee shop chain and want to create a Labeler that would allow people to display their favorite drink order.

Here is a list of some different Labelers to give you more inspiration and ideas:
- Bikesky Labeler
- Superbowl Labeler
- Pronouns Labeler
- The Cave of Trophonius
- Screenshots Labeler

Creating your own Labeler is not user-friendly at the moment, but it is possible if you have some coding/development skills. To get you started [check out this Github Repository](https://github.com/aliceisjustplaying/labeler-starter-kit-bsky) that a community member created to serve as a starter kit for creating a Labeler.

2. Feeds (Easy/Moderate)

One of the most popular, powerful, and relatively easy things you can do is create a custom feed using the no-code tool [graze.social](https://graze.social). In fact, I would recommend creating at least two different feeds: 1) an internal feed you use for actively listening for mentions of your brand, product, or cause, and 2) a public community feed that ties in with your niche in some way.

The internal feed is designed to include only mentions of your brand name, links to your website, or important keywords for monitoring trends. You, your social media manager, or customer support team can use this feed to stay on top of feedback or community questions. Keep in mind though that any feed you create is technically public and could be followed by any other user.

The public feed is your brand's contribution to the community. It should be a highly valuable feed that displays curated or relevant posts from other acounts that are about or adjacent to your niche. This feed shouldn't be specifically for just the people that are aware of you, but rather it should be for appealing to newcomers first and foremost. By doing this, you're providing a valuable free service to people and getting your brand name out there at the same time. Be tactful in how you promote yourself though using this method, most people are not going to be interested in a feed that is created or managed in a way that comes across as self promo or advertising.

To get started, check out some of these example feeds for reference:
- Feed 1
- Feed 2 

3. Starter packs (Easy)

4. Custom domains / handles (Moderate)

5. Moderation services

6. Public API
