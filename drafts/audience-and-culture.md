	- Determine audience response triggers.

Over the course of Bluesky’s two-year history thus far, its culture has shifted as the network has become more populated and diverse. When there were only several thousands users, the space reflected the industry it sprang out of, so it was very western tech-oriented. There were then growth eras that were dominated by other countries such as Japan or Brazil, with the latter case happening due to Elon Musk’s X temporarily abandoning Brazilian users entirely. 

The biggest growth event that the network experienced was in the days surrounding the 2024 United States presidential election, at which point millions of people created new Bluesky accounts in an effort to migrate off of big tech social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and X. In the months that followed, many people mistakenly started to assume that Bluesky had effectively become a politically left-leaning platform. In reality, the culture of Bluesky is so multi-faceted at this point that it really doesn’t make sense to think about it with such a hegemonic western lens. For starters, there isn’t a singular “Bluesky Culture” anymore. The user base is made up of over 30 million people from all over the world with an innumerable number of niche interests. 

Start thinking about Bluesky as a diverse system of hundreds (if not thousands) of large to small sub-cultures. Approaching the network with this perspective will better prepare you for all the different types of people you likely will encounter on any given day.
