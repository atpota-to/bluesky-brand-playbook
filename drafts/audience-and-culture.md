# Audience and Culture

Over the course of Bluesky’s two-year history, its culture has shifted as the network has become more populated. When there were only several thousands users, the space reflected the industry it sprang out of, so it was very United States tech-centric. Eventually there were growth periods that were dominated by other countries such as Japan or Brazil, with the latter case happening due to X temporarily abandoning Brazilian users entirely.

The biggest growth event that the network experienced though was in the days surrounding the 2024 United States presidential election, at which point millions of people created new Bluesky accounts in an effort to migrate off of big tech social networks like Facebook, Instagram, and X.

In the months that followed, many people mistakenly started to assume that Bluesky had effectively become a politically left-leaning platform. In reality, the culture of Bluesky is so multi-faceted at this point that it really doesn’t make sense to think about it with such a hegemonic lens. For starters, there isn’t a singular “Bluesky Culture” anymore. The user base is made up of over 30 million people from all over the world with an innumerable number of niche interests. 

Start thinking about Bluesky as a diverse system of hundreds (if not thousands) of large to small sub-cultures. Approaching the network with this perspective will better prepare you for all the different types of people you likely will encounter on any given day, and it will help you find the communities you are most interested in.

## Why people use Bluesky

While its true that Bluesky is hard to pin-down culturally, there are a variety of big ideas that tend to attract people to it and influence it on a monocultural level. Keeping these themes in mind will help you avoid committing a faux pas.

1. It’s an open, decentralized, interoperable network.

For the past two decades most people have only experienced an online social network that is both centralized and closed. Platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X became known for trying to keep people on their apps for as long as possible, even if it meant making the user experience worse by pushing invasive algorithms and hiding links to outside websites.

As the years went on and the user experienced continued to degrade, more and more people started to be fed up. A new future began to be conceived of, and experimental versions of alternative social apps started to gain some traction. The properties that defined these platforms were usually one or all of the following:

	A. Open

	A signficant portion of the network's data is publicly accessible via open APIs and storage. Additionally, anyone can create and host their own account.

	B. Decentralized
	
	The network is designed and implemented in such a way that one centralized entity can't own or control everything within it. Decentralization exists on a spectrum, but in general a decentralized social network will be accessible from many different apps called "clients" and the data on the network is somewhat distributed across many different "nodes". (Reddit and Twitter used to have third-party apps or clients, but in both cases the centralized entity's blocked access to the network data and caused numerous apps to go out of business)

	C. Interoperable
	
	The data and features that exist in one place can be used, supported, integrated, and adopted in many places. A simple example of this would be multiple different apps/services that use the same user profile data. You would log into a new app or service, it would recognize your existing profile data that you created on Bluesky, and it would automatically use that for your profile.	
	
Bluesky and its underlying protocol exhibit some form of all these properties, making it a very attractive candidate to replace or augment legacy platforms. To date, it is the most popular decentralized social network, having surpassed user growth milestones of earlier attempts like Mastodon and Nostr.
	
2. There aren’t any ads.

One of the primary reasons traditional corporations implement user-hostile things like link suppression and all-controlling algorithms is to maintain their revenue model: advertising. Their primary incentive is to keep users in their apps for as long as possible at all costs.

With Bluesky, an advertising model is not nearly as feasible or sustainable due to the underlying protocol’s design and open nature. If they began having advertisements in the Bluesky app, people could easily choose to consume the same content through the “window” of a third-party app that doesn’t have ads.

In this situation, the primary way to keep people using your app (and even get them to pay for it!) is to offer an unparalleled positive experience with advanced features. This framework better aligns the company’s incentives to be in step with users’ needs.

3. There’s more control.

One of the many benefits of an open and interoperable network is that users have greater control over their individual experiences. From the ability to choose your own algorithm (or lack thereof) to having third-party apps available, Bluesky empowers users with a significantly higher degree of agency in comparison to traditional social platforms. This reality also contributes to Bluesky’s multicultural environment... for any given user that you meet, you can’t assume that they are engaging with the network using the same “lens” that you are.

4. It’s not a traditional big tech corporation with controversial political affiliations.

Given the fact that almost all of the major social media platforms in the United States have decided to align themselves with a specific government administration, even to extreme degrees, many people are uncomfortable spending their time with products made by those companies. Bluesky does not have the same affiliations or baggage, making it an attractive alternative.

## What makes content appealing

Now that you understand Bluesky’s landscape, let’s talk about the kinds of content that people enjoy. These things are not unique to Bluesky though, because ultimately Bluesky isn’t so radically different that it fundamentally changes what motivates people to consume media in the first place. 

Let’s divide potential types of content into 5 distinct categories. Each of these is medium-agnostic, meaning content of these types could come in the form of text, video, graphics, audio, images, or some combination thereof. 

1. Helpful

- Informative (educational, news, how-tos)
- Inspiring (motivational, success stories)
- Thought-provoking (challenging perspectives)
- Guidance/Advice (solutions to problems)
- Resource-sharing (tools, templates, recommendations)

2. Entertaining

- Humorous (jokes, memes, witty observations)
- Storytelling (narratives, personal anecdotes)
- Creative expression (art, music, writing)
- Escapism (content that provides mental breaks)

3. Connecting

- Community-building (shared interests, values)
- Relatable content (validation of experiences)
- Cultural participation (trends, challenges, shared moments)
- Authenticity (genuine human experiences)
- Support/Empathy (emotional connection)

4. Identity-affirming

- Values alignment (content that reflects personal beliefs)
- Status signaling (association with prestigious content/people)
- Interest reinforcement (niche content for specific passions)
- Professional development (career-related content)
- Self-improvement (growth-oriented content)

5. Discovery

- Serendipity (unexpected but valuable finds)
- Curation (filtered selection of quality content)
- Trending information (being "in the know")
- Niche exploration (deep dives into specific topics)
- New perspectives (exposure to different viewpoints)

## How to be a good participant in the culture

1. Use alt text when posting images and do it properly
2. Add a verified domain
3. Don’t reply to someone’s post just to promote your product or engage in other growth “hacks” like mass-following.
4. Avoid automated cross-posting.
5. Avoid posting links to platforms like X.
6. Use and support AT Protocol-based services
7. More
